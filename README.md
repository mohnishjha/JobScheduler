Job Scheduler!

It so happens that our super computer is super powerful but confused about how to manage pile of tasks in front of it. So here we have a master scheduler and his workforce of 128 Worker nodes powered with 24 core cpus and 64GBs of RAM to the rescue. The project is still in development stages but is definitely an MVP. Will try to enhance it ASAP.
